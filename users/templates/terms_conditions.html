                            The Services generally allow a User, pursuant to the terms and conditions herein, to compare and re-phrase textual content User submits to the Services (“Submissions”) using the Services' proprietary Aluminotes  technology and obtain metrics therefrom.

                                User is required to create an account by providing the information set out in our Privacy Policy and then enter payment information to conclude an agreement to use our Paid Services. By clicking on the “buy aluminotes” button, User makes a binding offer to conclude an agreement for Paid Services. After that, a summary of the order will be displayed for review. Until clicking on the “buy aluminotes” button, User can cancel the order process at any time or change the information provided by deleting, adding, or correcting the information provided in the various fields or by closing his web browser or tab. Aluminotes shall provide its Services immediately after conclusion of the agreement.

                            <p>
                                If User purchases any Services that Aluminotes offers for a fee (“Paid Services”), such as a subscription to Aluminotes’ Services, User authorizes Aluminotes and its designated payment processors to store User's payment information and other related information. User also agrees to pay the applicable fees for the Paid Services (including without limitation periodic fees for ongoing subscriptions) (the “Subscription Fees”) as they become due plus all related taxes (including, without limitation, sales and use taxes, duties, or other governmental taxes or fees), and to reimburse Aluminotes for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. All fees are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for any partially used Paid Services (including partially used subscription periods) except: (i) as required by applicable law; and (ii) at Aluminotes’ sole and absolute discretion. Fees for the Paid Services may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially purchase the Paid Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section 4, all prices for Paid Services are subject to change without notice.

                            <p>
                                Aluminotes may, from time to time, offer various payment methods, including without limitation payment by credit card, by SEPA mandate through our PSP, by debit card, by check, or by certain payment providers. User authorizes Aluminotes to charge User for Paid Services through any payment method(s) User selects when purchasing the Paid Services (the “Payment Method”) and User agrees to make payment using such Payment Method(s) (Aluminotes  may, from time to time, receive and use updated payment method information provided by User or that financial institutions or payment processors may provide to Aluminotes to update information related to User's Payment Method(s), such as updated expiration dates or account numbers). Certain Payment Methods, such as credit cards and debit cards, may involve agreements between User and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of User's chosen Payment Methods (the “Payment Method Provider”). If Aluminotes does not receive payment from User's Payment Method Provider, User agrees to directly pay all amounts due upon demand from Aluminotes. User's non- termination or continued use of the Paid Services reaffirms that Aluminotes is authorized to charge User's Payment Method.

                                IF USER PAYS FOR A SUBSCRIPTION BY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD (OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD IDENTIFIED ON ALUMINOTES’ SERVICES OR A SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE AS INVOLVING AN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION) AND USER DOES NOT CANCEL USER'S SUBSCRIPTION AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 4, USER'S SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED FOR SUCCESSIVE RENEWAL PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED (FOR EXAMPLE, UNLESS USER CANCELS, A ONE MONTH SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW ON A MONTHLY BASIS). UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED IN ANY APPLICABLE ADDITIONAL TERMS OR COMMUNICATIONS ALUMINOTES SENDS TO USER'S REGISTERED EMAIL ADDRESS, SUCH RENEWAL WILL BE AT THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION FEE AS WHEN USER FIRST SUBSCRIBED, PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES, UNLESS ALUMINOTES NOTIFIES USER AT LEAST 10 DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF USER'S CURRENT TERM THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE WILL INCREASE. USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT USER’S PAYMENT METHOD WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTION FEES, PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES, UPON EACH SUCH AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. USER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT USER'S SUBSCRIPTION IS SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC RENEWALS AND USER CONSENTS TO AND ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL RECURRING CHARGES TO USER'S CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD (OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD, AS APPLICABLE) BASED ON THIS AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FEATURE WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM USER AND WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. USER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE RECURRING CHARGE MAY CHANGE IF THE APPLICABLE TAX RATES CHANGE OR IF USER IS NOTIFIED THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEES.

                            <p>
                                TO CHANGE OR CANCEL USER'S SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME, USER MAY GO TO THE “ACCOUNT” PAGE AFTER LOGGING INTO THEIR ACCOUNT AND ELECT TO “CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION.” IF USER CANCELS USER'S SUBSCRIPTION, USER'S SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE END OF USER'S THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM, BUT USER'S SUBSCRIPTION WILL NOT BE RENEWED AFTER THAT TERM EXPIRES. USER WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO A PRORATED REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEES PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

                                User agrees to provide current, complete, and accurate billing information and agrees to promptly update all such information (such as changes in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date) as necessary for the processing of all payments that are due to Aluminotes. User agrees to promptly notify Aluminotes if User's Payment Method is canceled (for example, due to loss or theft) or if User becomes aware of a potential breach of security related to User's Payment Method. If User fails to provide any of the foregoing information, User acknowledges that User's current Payment Method may continue to be charged for Paid Services and that User will remain responsible for all such charges.

                            <p>
                                If the total amount to be charged varies from the amount User authorized when purchasing any Paid Services (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of taxes, including without limitation sales and use taxes, duties or other governmental taxes or fees), Aluminotes will provide notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the transaction. If User does not cancel User's Paid Services before the increased price goes into effect, User agrees to pay the increased price for the Paid Services. User agrees that Aluminotes may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charge during or at the end of each billing cycle. Aluminotes will inform User of any additional charges which are accumulated.

                                Ordering Paid Services involves utilizing the secured server of a payment processing service provider (“PSP,” e.g., Stripe). Neither PSP nor any person or company related to PSP holds any ownership interest in the Services or Aluminotes, nor receives any financial benefit from the Services or Aluminotes other than a fee paid by Aluminotes to PSP for the services performed by PSP. Aluminotes makes absolutely no representations and/or warranties, and provides no assurances, regarding the PSP, the PSP owner, or the quality, availability, security, legality, or description of the payment processing services offered thereon. ALUMINOTES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON- INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE PSP AND/OR THE SERVICES OFFERED THEREON.

                                    Aluminotes may, in its sole discretion, set limits on User's API usage including, without limitation, limits on the frequency with which User's requests are processed. Aluminotes may change such usage limits at any time, and/or may utilize technical measures to prevent over-usage and/or stop usage of the APIs by an application after any usage limitations are exceeded.

User agrees only to use Aluminotes’ word mark ALUMINOTES, if at all, factually and in connection with User's implementation of the API in User's application or product. User shall not use any other Brand Feature in any other way. User shall not modify or alter any Brand Feature or use them in a confusing way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Aluminotes, or in a way that confuses Aluminotes with another brand.

Beta Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions that User must accept. ALUMINOTES MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT BETA SERVICES WILL BECOME PART OF THE SERVICES GENERALLY AVAILABLE AND RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DISCONTINUE OR CHANGE THE BETA SERVICES AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.
